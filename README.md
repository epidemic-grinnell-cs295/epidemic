# epidemic

Epidemic is a semi-abstract resource management game where you play as the new 
health policy manager for a small town experiencing a severe epidemic outbreak. 
You must balance the health of your citizens against their happiness and the 
department budget, while identifying movement patterns and infection hotspots. 
Win by weathering the outbreak and saving as many people as possible!
