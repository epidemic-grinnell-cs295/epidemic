# epidemic
A game about managing a population threatened by an epidemic. WIP.

## Scenes
The current version has a few different projects going on in different scenes.
If you want to try something new, you can do it in a new scene.

Main and Menu scenes: Nora's gui project.

DebugEnv: The old demo, with lists of people and locations. Good for testing out
changes to the underlying model.

EliMainInProgress: Structural changes to the object hierarchy and script names.
This will be merged into Nora's gui when she merges the new version.

SpriteTest: Empty world for testing out moving and animating sprites.
